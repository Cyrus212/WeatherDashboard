# WeatherDashboard

## Description

Building this app allowed me to learn more about dynamically creating elements.

With this app, users can search up what the current weather is based on the City that they input.

## Usage

To use this application, just input the City of your choosing and click the search button. This will bring up the data and it will also store the City in the Recent Searches section to allow you to not only see your last search but also click on a button to bring that data for that city back.
